# FYP
First year project 2023

#Purpose
The main purpose of the project is to predict if a lesion is cancerous or not.

#Features
The folder features contains a csv file with all the data we have gathered from a public data-set that can be found here: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/zr7vgbcyr2/1

#Utilities
Our code uses another csv that contains various colors that can help us categorize each segment of the lesion by its color.
